# FP Light Demo

This project is to demo the functionality of the [FP Light](https://github.com/Sullux/fp-light) library.

## Installation and Setup

In the terminal, run these two commands to clone the repo and change to the project folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sullux/fp-light-demo.git
cd fp-light-demo
```

Next, run `npm i` (or `yarn install` if you prefer yarn to NPM).

## Running Existing Tests/Scripts

This module uses [the jest testing framework](https://jestjs.io/) to run the test files. As a quick primer, from the terminal when you are in the project folder you can do things like this (note that these will work with `yarn` instead of `npm` if you prefer):

* `npm test` run all the tests in the project (there will be a lot of console logs!)
* `npm test c1` run the test file whose name starts with "c1"
* `npm test testability` run all test files in the "testability" folder

This is brand new project that is probably still full of typos, but I hope it helps get you on your way to a declarative, functional future!
